lost in thought  
under the stars  
breaking the silence  
chasing the wind  
across the sea  
behind closed doors  
through the mist  
painted in gold  
echoes of yesterday  
beyond the veil  
hold your breath  
follow your bliss  
against all odds  
into the wild  
beneath the surface  
through thick fog  
dancing with shadows  
grasping at straws  
between the lines  
infinite blue sky  
whispers of time  
moments of clarity  
shards of light  
rays of hope  
flicker and fade  
drawn to fire  
searching for meaning  
tangled in dreams  
frozen in time  
caught in motion  
embrace the unknown  
ride the wave  
face your fears  
trust the process  
open your heart  
ignite the spark  
feel the rain  
walk the line
